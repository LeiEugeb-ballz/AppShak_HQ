AppShak Office — Cognitive Organism Multi-Agent System
vNext Specification Implementation

A visual "office" metaphor for autonomous multi-agent orchestration with:
- Agent Desks: Where each agent works on their specialized tasks
- Water Cooler: Random idle agent pairs sharing summaries/questions
- Boardroom: All agents come together for project discussions, launches, upskills

Seven North Stars guide all agent behavior:
1. Continuous Problem-Solving and Growth
2. Emergent Intelligence Expansion
3. Autonomous Value Creation
4. Collaborative Competence Building
5. Persistent Adaptation and Influence
6. Self-Improving Collective Agency
7. Enduring Ecosystem Evolution
